title: Computer Science isn't IT
categories: 
---
If I tell people that I’m enrolled in a computer science degree, most people don’t know what it is, they just assume I fix computers. There’s a great paragraph on wikipedia that explains my frustration

{% blockquote %}
“The general public sometimes confuses computer science with careers that deal with computers (such as the noun Information Technology), or think that it relates to their own experience of computers, which typically involves activities such as gaming, web-browsing, and word-processing. However, the focus of computer science is more on understanding the properties of the programs used to implement software such as games and web-browsers, and using that understanding to create new programs or improve existing ones.”
