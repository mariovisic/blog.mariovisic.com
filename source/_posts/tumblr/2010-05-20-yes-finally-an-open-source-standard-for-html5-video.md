I was waiting for google to announce what they would do with their purchase of
the VP8 codec they purchased from On2 technologies, hoping they would open
source it to provide a universal HTML5 video standard that was both open source
and provided quality comparable or better than H264.
Great new is they&#8217;ve done it. Here&#8217;s the article on engadget:
