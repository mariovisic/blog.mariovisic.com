I was waiting for google to announce what they would do with their purchase of the VP8 codec they purchased from On2 technologies, hoping they would open source it to provide a universal HTML5 video standard that was both open source and provided quality comparable or better than H264.

Great new is theyâ€™ve done it. [Here is the article on engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/19/google-launches-open-webm-web-video-format-based-on-vp8/)
