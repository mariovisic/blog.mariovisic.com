Dear Youtube.

I can’t understand how you can call the HTML5 video player a beta product when it is more stable than the flash video player offered. The HTML5 video player seems to seek better, takes less time to start playback after buffering and doesn’t cause the CPU fan on my machine to spin up like it’s about to explode.

Perhaps the flash video player should be called a beta product and the HTML5 player stable?

You can try the beta for yourself by [enabling it here](http://youtube.com/html5). Just click the link to activate, it only works for videos without advertising and it will say HTML5 near the bottom when activated. Works on Safari/Chrome only for the moment.

PS. Tell your big brother Google that their web browser Chrome is awesome!
