So I got a little bit bored today and wanted a change to my daily routine. I
realised that I havent done any Project Euler problems in quite a while. If
you dont know what Project Euler is and youre into programming or math then
have a read over here ==> _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_p_r_o_j_e_c_t_e_u_l_e_r_._n_e_t_/_i_n_d_e_x_._p_h_p_?_s_e_c_t_i_o_n_=_a_b_o_u_t. Its
basically a great way to practise your math and programming skills. You can
compete with your friends also which is fun :) I started when my friend _T_y_s_o_n
suggested he could solve me than me.
Ive been solving my euler problems in Ruby because & well why not? Today I
managed to solve 3 problems, taking my grand total to 3333 oouutt ooff aa ppoossssiibbllee 330000
problems. <=== Sounds more exciting when its in bold, right?
So while solving all these problems im slowly developing a set of simple
libraries that are used across multiple problems. Seems to be saving me a bit
of time now. The helper libraries (well only 1 at the moment) are available
over at github _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_g_i_t_h_u_b_._c_o_m_/_m_a_r_i_o_v_i_s_i_c_/_P_r_o_j_e_c_t_-_E_u_l_e_r_-_R_u_b_y_-_H_e_l_p_e_r_s.
