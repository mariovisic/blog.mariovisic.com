A few months ago a friend and coworker of mine pointed me towards [Locomotive CMS](http://www.locomotivecms.com/), a content management system built on ruby on rails which has multi site
support out of the box and has a really pretty admin interface.

I have been helping out Locomotive CMS for a while now in my spare time. I've been fixing bugs here and there and helping out users that require assistance. A couple of days ago I was appointed as one of the maintainers for the project, YAY.

Locomotive is really neat, you should totally check it out!
