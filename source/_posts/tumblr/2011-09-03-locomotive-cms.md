A few months ago a friend and coworker of mine pointed me towards _L_o_c_o_m_o_t_i_v_e
_C_M_S, a content management system built on ruby on rails which has multi site
support out of the box and has a really pretty admin interface.
I have been helping out Locomotive CMS for a while now in my spare time.
I've been fixing bugs here and there and helping out users that require
assistance. A couple of days ago I was appointed as one of the maintainers for
the project, YAY.
Locomotive is really neat, you should totally check it out!
