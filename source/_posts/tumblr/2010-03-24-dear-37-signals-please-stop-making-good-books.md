I borrowed __G_e_t_t_i_n_g_ _R_e_a_l__ _b_y_ _3_7_s_i_g_n_a_l_s last night from a friend, a book about
the new hip way to build web applications. I read the first 50 pages last night
and was up until 2am doing so. Although I am quite tired after the late night,
I cant wait to read the rest!
