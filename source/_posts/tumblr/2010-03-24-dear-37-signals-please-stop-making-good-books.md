I borrowed [Getting Real by 37signals](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/) last night from a friend, a book about the new hip way to build web applications. I read the first 50 pages last night and was up until 2am doing so. Although I am quite tired after the late night, I canâ€™t wait to read the rest!
