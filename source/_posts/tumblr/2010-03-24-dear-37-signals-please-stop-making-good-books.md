I borrowed _&_#_8_2_1_6_;_G_e_t_t_i_n_g_ _R_e_a_l_&_#_8_2_1_7_;_ _b_y_ _3_7_s_i_g_n_a_l_s last night from a friend, a
book about the new hip way to build web applications. I read the first 50 pages
last night and was up until 2am doing so. Although I am quite tired after the
late night, I can&#8217;t wait to read the rest!
