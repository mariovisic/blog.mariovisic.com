I just finished reading _t_h_i_s_ _a_r_t_i_c_l_e; and let me tell you, WOW, just WOW!
About half way through the article I started to realise that the name was ever
so familiar and that i&#8217;d heard it before. Just the other day I was
watching an episode of Never Mind the Buzzcocks which Peter was a guest
panelist. This is how I found out he&#8217;s also the voice actor for Darth
Maul in the first Star Wars episode.
The article is very well written and points to how our society is moving
forward from hard copy formats to digital copies of music and video.
