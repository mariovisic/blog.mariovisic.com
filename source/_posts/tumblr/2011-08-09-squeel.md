I've been using a really neat gem lately called Squeel, it provides extra
support for active record to do lots of neat things. There's heaps of
examples [at the homepage](http://erniemiller.org/projects/squeel/).

Today I managed to get a patch into squeel (YAY!). I found a bug which was only
occurring on ruby 1.9.2 sporadically. I wrote a failing spec and the author
[Ernie](http://twitter.com/erniemiller) created a fix on the very same day.
