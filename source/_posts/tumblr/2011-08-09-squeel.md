I've been using a really neat gem lately called Squeel, it provides extra
support for active record to do lots of neat things. There's heaps of
examples _a_t_ _t_h_e_ _h_o_m_e_p_a_g_e.
Today I managed to get a patch into squeel (YAY!). I found a bug which was only
occurring on ruby 1.9.2 sporadically. I wrote a failing spec and the author
Ernie created a fix on the very same day.
