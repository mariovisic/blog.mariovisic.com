Maybe it's because i'm pedantic? or maybe it's because
i'm a perfectionist? or maybe just because I was bored? I decided to
create my own tumblr theme just for me.
I wasn't really satisfied with one of the standard tumblr themes, not
because they aren't any good, in fact there was quite a few which were
&#8216;almost just right' but I kept on thinking &#8220;wouldn't it
be better if this was like that instead of how it is&#8221;. As a result I
spent a few hours last night creating my own theme and here it is. I've
even given it a name, CClleeaarr BBlluuee. As you can probably tell, i'm not a
huge fan of big complex designs, Clear Blue is very minimal but very cclleeaann,
which is how I like it.
Creating the design was fairly straightforward. tumblr provides a really good
guide with lots of information here _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_w_w_w_._t_u_m_b_l_r_._c_o_m_/_d_o_c_s_/_e_n_/
_c_u_s_t_o_m___t_h_e_m_e_s. There was a few little hurdles I ran into so I thought i'd
run through the process I used in creating my theme.
If you're not comfortable playing around with raw HTML and CSS then you
can safely stop reading here, otherwise continue on :)

The first thing to do is head over to the link above and copy the markup where
it says HHeerree&&##88221177;;ss aann eexxaammppllee ooff tthhee ccoommpplleettee mmaarrkkuupp ffoorr aa tthheemmee. Paste it
into your favourite text editor, for me i'm using TextMate on my Mac. Now
you'll need to figure out what extra features you'll want your
design to have. For me I've included the date and tags for each post as
well as extra menu items and the accounts i'm stalking erm&#8230;
following. If you find you're getting stuck at this point, the best thing
to do is go to the customise page in your tumblr account. Once there, select
tthheemmee and then uussee ccuussttoomm HHTTMMLL. This will give you the current themes complete
markup, this will show how the author of another theme has done a particular
item. Have a look through different themes to add features.
So now you'll find that we have a lot of markup with tumblr specific
tags. At this point it's going to be a bit hard to style anything as we
have no content. What I decided to do was head over to the customize page in my
tumblr account and paste the current markup i'd been working on into the
current theme and save. Now if we head over to our frontpage we'll find
our blog with our current theme applied. There shouldn't be any styling
but we need to make sure that all of our features are displaying correctly, so
if you've setup the date of posts and it's not appearing then some
fixing may be required. If all the information we want is displaying on the
page then grab a copy of the pages source code and save to a new html file on
your local machine (Normally View ==> Source in your web browser).

Everyone is going to do this step differently so I won't go into much
detail. For me i've decided to use the _9_6_0_._g_s_ _C_S_S_ _F_r_a_m_e_w_o_r_k to make
things easier. If you're going to be working with external CSS files or
images then you can _uu_pp_ll_oo_aa_dd_ _yy_oo_uu_rr_ _ss_tt_aa_tt_ii_cc_ _ff_ii_ll_ee_ss_ _tt_oo_ _tt_uu_mm_bb_ll_rr which makes it easier to
work with those external files. Once you're done styling then paste the
markup back into the custom HTML section of the cuztomize tumblr page.
Lastly comes our variables (which are optional). I decided not to use any
variables at this point as my theme is only for me at the moment. In the future
I might distribute it, although at the moment it remains for me only. Once
again you can find the information for this on the _t_u_m_b_l_r_ _t_h_e_m_i_n_g_ _g_u_i_d_e.
