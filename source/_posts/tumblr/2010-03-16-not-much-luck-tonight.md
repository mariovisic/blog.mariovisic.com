title: Not much luck tonight

I don&#8217;t seem to be having the best of luck tonight. I&#8217;ve come home
after suffering defeat at indoor soccer, we lost by a goal with a final score
of 4-3. We did play very well though, which i&#8217;m proud of. It was a hard
fought loss.
 Apple Image displayed during boot
After about 30 minutes of using my laptop it decides to freeze up requiring a
reboot. Only it didn&#8217;t come back up after rebooting. It displays a folder
icon with a question mark where the apple logo normally is during boot and
doesn&#8217;t go any further.
I attempted to recover the boot partition by using my trusty Snow Leopard Disk,
It&#8217;s a mac :) When I go to repair the disk I get the error &#8216;Invalid
content in Journal&#8217; and then later &#8216;Invalid B-tree node
size&#8217;.
This is the second time that the boot partition had corrupted for this hard
drive within the last few weeks. ItÂ defiantlyÂ seems like the hard drive is
about to die. Such a shame because it was a nice and fast 128GB SSD. Replacing
it is going to cost over $400 which is a bit to fork out for a student like
myself. I&#8217;m hoping the warranty is still valid, but I still have to check
it and see.
