I just finished reading [this article](http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2010/05/why-i-steal-movies%E2%80%A6-even-ones-im-in/) and let me tell you, WOW, just WOW!

About half way through the article I started to realise that the name was ever so familiar and that i’d heard it before. Just the other day I was watching an episode of Never Mind the Buzzcocks which Peter was a guest panelist. This is how I found out he’s also the voice actor for Darth Maul in the first Star Wars episode.

The article is very well written and points to how our society is moving forward from hard copy formats to digital copies of music and video.
