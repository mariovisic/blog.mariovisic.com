For a little while I haven't had any spare time to do any original open source work. I'd still been contributing to [Locomotive CMS](http://www.locomotivecms.com/), fixing bugs and generally just helping out, but I haven't had the chance to work on anything new. Thankfully for a client project of mine I had the chance to create a new gem.

So, yesterday at work I released the [activemerchant-bpoint gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/activemerchant-bpoint). A small plugin for Active Merchant that provides a billing gateway for the commonwealth bank's BPOINT merchant gateway service. It's really great to work in [an environment that encourages open source work](http://www.sentia.com.au/). Hopefully this is just the start and I hope in the future that i'll be able to open source much more of the work I do.
